//	FILENAME: server_WelcomeCredits.sqf
//	=====
//	SCRIPT NAME: Server Intro Credits Script by IT07
//	SCRIPT VERSION: v1.3.7 BETA
//	Credits for original script: Bohemia Interactive http://bistudio.com

//	========== SCRIPT CONFIG ============
_onScreenTime = 6; 		//how long one role should stay on screen. Use value from 0 to 10 where 0 is almost instant transition to next role
	//NOTE: Above value is not in seconds. It is percentage. Default: 6

//	==== CUSTOMIZING THE CREDITS ===
//	If you want more or less credits on the screen, you have to add/remove roles.
//	Watch out though, you need to make sure BOTH role lists match eachother in terms of amount.
//	Just take a good look at the _role1 and the rest and you will see what I mean.

//	== CUSTOMIZING TEXT COLOR ==
//	Find line 49 and look for: color='#f2cb0b'
//  #f2cb0b is the HTML color code for the text. As well as #FFFFFF in the row below it.
//	Find the color code you want here: http://html-color-codes.info
